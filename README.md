# Account Disclaimer

This is my **personal** and **secondary** GitHub account.

- It is maintained independently and is **not** my primary account for any employer or organization.
- Any code, projects, opinions, or written content here reflect **personal development and experimentation** only.
- Nothing in this account should be interpreted as representing the views, strategies, products, or intellectual property of any current or past employer, client, or partner.

## Repository Visibility

A majority of the repositories on this account are **private**.

This is intentional and primarily for:
- **Data security**
- **Confidentiality of datasets, credentials, and infrastructure details**
- **Protection of proprietary or sensitive materials** (even in personal projects)
- **Controlled sharing with specific collaborators when needed**

When repositories are public, they are shared to demonstrate specific concepts, patterns, or tools — and are curated to avoid exposing sensitive information.

## Contact

If you need access to something that’s private for legitimate collaboration or review purposes, feel free to reach out through GitHub.
